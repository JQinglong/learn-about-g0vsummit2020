## g0v Summit 2020 content
Compared to the previous g0v Summit, which lasted for 2-3 days with a single venue, g0v Summit 2020 expanded its participation and connected the local communities, launching 4 consecutive days of hackathons, short talks, themed forums, free dialogue, and unconference. Workshops and event venues have also been extended to several locations in different places in the urban area, including spaces and masses that have been operated by local communities for many years.
