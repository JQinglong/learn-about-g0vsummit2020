# 社群簡介

Since 2012, the civic tech movement has been sweeping across the globe. G0v, a community that advocates open source, transparency of information and civic participation, also rode the wave and launched the first event that year with the slogan ""Code to refactor society"". Since then, the movement continues with no sight of ending.

Over the past 8 years, g0v has invited thousands of participants to join our hackathons and in turn created several platforms that promote open data and open government. g0v aims to reduce the digital divide and allow citizens easy access to public information, so that discussion of issues can be based on facts. It can also raise the awareness of rational discussion on public affairs.

In this open data and open government movement, the g0v community has also created a new model for the Taiwan society and the government to interact with each other.
